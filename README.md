## About the Project
The Radiology Center Management System is a comprehensive solution designed to streamline and optimize the operations of a multi-branch radiology center. The system empowers healthcare administrators, doctors, assistants, and accountants with secure and role-based access, ensuring efficient management of patient data, appointments, and financial transactions.

## Key Features
1. **Multi-Branch Structure** – Supports multiple branches, each with its own users and data, allowing decentralized management.  
2. **Role-Based Access Control** – Distinct privileges for doctors, admins, assistants, and accountants to maintain data security.  
3. **Super-Admin Control** – Central authority to manage users, roles, and branch data across the system.  
4. **User Management** – Add and assign users to specific branches with role-based access.  
5. **Appointment Scheduling** – Efficiently manage patient appointments.  
6. **Data Security & Privacy** – Built using .NET Framework, Linq, Entity Framework, and MS SQL Server with strong encryption and authentication.  
7. **Windows Form Interface** – User-friendly interface for staff with minimal learning curve.  
8. **Reporting & Analytics** – Generate reports to support decision-making and branch performance analysis.

The system provides a secure, efficient, and scalable platform for managing multi-branch radiology operations.
